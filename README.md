# Bluepill dev environment cookbook.

Little helper to aid in development of bluepill.

Make sure to set the exported vagrant path to the checkout of whatever you're working on. Also, you should override node['bluepill_devel']['ruby']['version'] with whatever ruby you need to test against. By default, you get 2.0.0-p353.
